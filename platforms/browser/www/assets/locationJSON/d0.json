        "story" : "Called the first major neoclassical or Greek Revival structure in the United States, The Bank of Pennsylvannia acted as the central reserve bank of the state. The bank's design is based off of ancient structures and temples from Greece. In 1857 a financial panic collasped the bank, leaving the building vacant until the Civil War when it was used as a federal prison. After the bank was demolished in 1867, the Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce rose in its place.  One of its Ionic columns was salvaged and given to G.A.R. Post No. 8 to be used as a memorial for Civil War dead at Glenwood Cemetery. Since 1933, the U.S. Custom House has occupied the site.",
