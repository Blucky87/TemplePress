        "story" : "In the early 1950s, the City of Philadelphia began discussions with the Phillies and the Eagles about replacing both the aging Baker Bowl and Connie Mack Stadium with a new facility. After years of wrangling over location, design, and cost, Philadelphia held the ground-breaking ceremonies for its multipurpose sports stadium on October 2, 1967. At a cost of $52 million, Veterans Stadium, known as “the Vet,” was one of the most expensive sports arenas in the country.",
        "notes" : "The Vet closed in October 2003, shortly after the Atlanta Braves defeated the Phillies, 5–2, in the final game at the stadium. Before the demolition, more than 20,000 stadium seats were sold at $280 a pair. On Sunday, March 21, 2004, the thirty-three-year-old stadium was imploded"
