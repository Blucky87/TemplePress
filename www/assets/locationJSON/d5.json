In response, Richard Allen, Absalom Jones and other black Methodists left St. George's en masse and established the African Church of Philadelphia. With the support of the Society of Friends, the Pennsylvania Abolition Society, and private citizens, they purchased land at Fifth and Adelphi streets and began construction.",
